<p>A three-part assertiveness message consists of three parts<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">[<!-- -->1<!-- -->]</a></sup>:</p>
<ol>
<li>A nonjudgmental description of the behavior to be changed</li>
<li>A disclosure of the asserter&#x27;s feelings</li>
<li>A clarification of the concrete and tangible effect of the other person&#x27;s behavior on the asserter</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>These are Bolton&#x27;s tips for writing effective assertion messages<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">[<!-- -->1<!-- -->]</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Describe the behavior in specific rather than fuzzy terms:</p>
<p>&quot;When you don&#x27;t shovel the snow from the driveway before going to school...&quot; vs. &quot;When you don&#x27;t do your part around the house...&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit yourself to behavioral descriptions and do not draw inferences about the other person&#x27;s motives, attitudes, character, and so on:</p>
<p>&quot;When you were so bored durign the meeting that you left early&quot; vs. &quot;When you left the meeting twenty minutes before your report was to be given...&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make your behavior description an objective statement rather than a judgment:</p>
<p>&quot;When you say women are incapable of being effective managers...&quot; vs. &quot;When you behave like a chauvinistic pig...&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid absolutes, such as &quot;never&quot;, &quot;always,&quot; and &quot;constantly&quot;:</p>
<p>&quot;When you constantly interrupt me...&quot; vs. &quot;When you interrupt me before I have completed my statement...&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid profanity:</p>
<p>&quot;When you drag your ass in here late for supper night after night...&quot; vs. &quot;When you do not call me to let me know you will be late for supper...&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep subtle judgments from creeping in:</p>
<p>&quot;When you overspend our clothing budget...&quot; vs. &quot;When you waste our hard-earned money on unnecessary clothing...&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be brief to reinforce clarity:</p>
<p>&quot;When you are frequently late for supper...&quot; vs. &quot;When you get all invovled in your football game and forget about the family and come home late and all dirty for dinner...&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The entire message should be compressed into a single sentence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that you are addressing a real issue and not another topic than the one that is really troubling you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that you are being assertive to the right person: is this really the person you are having an issue with?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you cannot find a tangible effect on your physical or psychological space, you might be attempting to impose your values on the other person:</p>
<p>&quot;When you wear jeans to the school play it annoys me and I feel irritated.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&#x27;t try to send an assertion for a third party. Let them send their own.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why these work</h2>
<p>These are Bolton&#x27;s reasons for believing that three-part assertion messages work and are effective<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">[<!-- -->1<!-- -->]</a></sup>:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a high probability that the other will alter the troublesome behavior</li>
<li>There is a low probability that I will violate teh other person&#x27;s space</li>
<li>There is little likelihood that of diminishing the other person&#x27;s self-esteem</li>
<li>There is low risk of damaging the relationship</li>
<li>There is a low risk of diminishing motivation</li>
<li>THere is little likelihood that defensiveness will escalate to destructive levels</li>
