<ul>
<li><strong>Explanatory</strong>: a statement about what is there, what it does, and how and why</li>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: familiar and currently uncontroversial knowledge</li>
<li><strong>Implicit</strong>: knowledge that cannot be quite put into words, though in some cases we may be able to do so upon further inspection: I cannot tell you how I tie my shoelaces — I just do it — but if I watch myself closely as I do it, I can explain to you how I do it<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>.</li>

<h2>Knowledge and Intelligence</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The presence of knowledge does not imply intelligence<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Machine learning algorithms can contain knowledge, e.g. whether a picture contains a cat or a dog, but that does not imply that it is intelligent.

<h2>An Appearance of Design</h2>
<p>If we encounter something that contains knowledge, it often has the <em>apperance</em> of having been designed<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.

This is not necessarily the case, although it can be, e.g. humans breeding dogs to be submissive and behave in certain ways.</p>
<h2>Substrate Independence</h2>
<p>Knowledge is not dependant on its substrate. The same information that is contained in DNA can be written as a file on a disk, on a paper, or in a million of other ways<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>.</p>
